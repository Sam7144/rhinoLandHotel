                    My girlfriend and I were in Chicago for the weekend and chose the Whitehall Hotel for its great location and price. We couldn’t have chosen a better place. Taelor, one of the desk clerks, greeted us with what is perhaps some of the best customer service we have ever experienced. It was like she was expecting us, and was eager to host us. Shellie, another lovely lady at the front desk, also impressed us with her professionalism and top-notch service. The hotel is in one of the best spots in the city. It’s close to the lakefront, and also to the Northside of Chicago where there are plenty of things to do, places to eat, etc. 
                    We will definitely be returning. - Guest from New York City, NY

                    Was the best experience at a hotel that we have had in a very long time. The staff is very customer service oriented and highly recommend it if its your first time in Chicago 
                    and or celebrating a special occasion. - Guest from Washington DC

                    The friendly staff, clean rooms, and great location keeps me coming back to the Whitehall Hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to great shopping and dining. I always enjoy breakfast at their Fornetto MEI restaurant and they make the best

                    I enjoyed staying at the Whitehall Hotel because of its central location to a conference that I attended. The front desk staff were very friendly during both check-in and check-out and also provided suggestions as to where I might want to go shopping nearby. There is a beautiful historic church nearby that was a great place to stop and have a moment of peace. The room accommodations were very nice. I would 
                    stay at The Whitehall Hotel again. - Guest from Minneapolis, MN
