                    <p><b>Cancellations</b>: May cancel up to 24 hours prior to check-in time, 3 PM GMT.</p>
                    <p><b>Bookings</b>: Valid Credit/Debit card & expiration date must be given upon booking. We reserve the right to cancel reservations without notice if the credit card used to guarantee the room is unable to be authorized for an amount equal to the first nightâ€™s stay. Valid government-issued ID must be presented at check-in.  The government-issued ID must match the name on the credit card presented at check-in.  If you will be paying with a payment card other than your own, 
                        you must contact us for alternate arrangements.</p>
                        <p><b>Credit / Debit Cards</b>
                        All payment cards must have an active and working chip. We will not use a magnetic stripe or manually enter card numbers for authorization or payments.  If your card does not have an active working chip, you will be required to offer a different form of payment.  All reservations require authorization of $75 per day for credit or debit cards.  This authorization will be held until check out.  We reserve the right to charge against this authorization for any additional charges that were not collected at 
                        check out or for any damage or missing hotel property.

                        Please note: If you choose to use a debit card at check-in, the authorization will be held by your bank but will immediately be unavailable in your account.  The entire authorized amount will be held until your departure date when our system will send a release authorization notice if any of the authorized funds have not been used. Depending on your bank, it could take 5 to 10 business days domestically or up to 30 days internationally, for your bank to release the funds back to you.  The authorized amount never leaves your bank 
                        unless it is used for purchases, damage or missing hotel property.
